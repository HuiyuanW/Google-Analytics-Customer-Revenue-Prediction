# Google-Analytics-Customer-Revenue-Prediction
Predict how much GStore customers will spend

The 80/20 rule has proven true for many businessesâ€“only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies.

In this work, analysis will be done on a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. More details: [Kaggle Competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction)
