    "This notebook will analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset from Kaggle competition ['Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction'](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction) to predict revenue per customer. \n",

    "\n",
    "* fullVisitorId- A unique identifier for each user of the Google Merchandise Store.\n",
    "* channelGrouping - The channel via which the user came to the Store.\n",

    "* geoNetwork - This section contains information about the geography of the user.\n",
    "* sessionId - A unique identifier for this visit to the store.\n",
    "* socialEngagementType - Engagement type, either \"Socially Engaged\" or \"Not Socially Engaged\".\n",
    "* totals - This section contains aggregate values across the session.\n",
    "* trafficSource - This section contains information about the Traffic Source from which the session originated.\n",
    "* visitId - An identifier for this session. This is part of the value usually stored as the _utmb cookie. This is only unique to the user. For a completely unique ID, you should use a combination of fullVisitorId and visitId.\n",
    "* visitNumber - The session number for this user. If this is the first session, then this is set to 1.\n",
